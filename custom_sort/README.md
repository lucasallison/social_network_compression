# Custom Sorting Algorithms

This subdirectory contains algorithms which order edge lists based on custom sorting algorithm, which can in turn be used by the webgraph framework to compress them.

## Edge Sort Base Class

The file "edge_sort.h" contains the base class which is called in the main function. The base class can be extended by different child class implementation in order to experiment with different algorithms to sort the edges.

## Similarity Sort

Sorts the nodes based on similarity ... reference paper


## TODO's

Currently the edge list is saved by the program as an adjacency matrix
